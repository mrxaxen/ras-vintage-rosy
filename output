"Before the Great Falling. Before corruption spread like a poison. Before the traitors and hopeless legions marched.There was an era of prosperity and might &mdash; when master artisans tempered blades worthy of emperors, when warriors grew heavy on silver and crimson victories, when women spun silken webs of intrigue, and when lords commanded with the authority of Heaven itself.
Battles thundered across the land in the name of the Throne, summoning the boldest hearts to seize honor &mdash; or vanish into nameless dust.
Every smith, every craftsman, every laborer poured their spirit into creation. The most gifted among them rose near the rank of sages, devoting their entire existence to the perfection of their sacred art.
In that radiant age, armors of peerless strength were born, forged with secrets that only the Grandmasters of the forge could summon forth.
But now&hellip; all is swallowed by time.What lingers are but a few forgotten scrolls, guarded by generations scarred with sorrow, now crumbling in silence upon dust-laden shelves and within the hollowed ruins of forsaken citadels.Only fragments remain &mdash; scattered like stars across a broken world, waiting for one with courage to unearth them, claim them, and restore their brilliance.
The Celestial Forge of perfection awaits you &mdash; step forward, and let your hands rekindle the eternal flame that shapes destiny."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This series of mods aims to introduce historically inspired armors into the game.This one is dedicated to the medieval China, specificaly introduces armor of Song, and Ming dynasty.
Armors added by this mod are somewhat improved versions of the vanilla items, which serve as the base for crafting these modded armors.Chineese military was known for their archery skills, the armors are made in this image.
&nbsp;
You will, as always need a specific schematic, which can be found in newly generated ruins or may appear at the Treasure Trader (Useful traders compatible) once he restocks after you install this mod.Due to the rarity of these schematics, their price won&rsquo;t exactly be a bargain.
&nbsp;
Anyway, as always if some errors pop up somewhere &mdash; let me know if you find some.I&rsquo;m aware that the recipes are VERY expensive, and that&rsquo;s intentional &mdash; these armors represent very late-game technology. On the bright side, once crafted, the armor is easy to maintain.
All feedback is welcome too, and the availability of this armor in survival mode can be rebalanced in the future if there&rsquo;s enough pushback.

Chronicle of The Great Jianyu
Jianyu:Master Liang Shen&hellip; every time I see these armors, I feel they carry something more than iron. The Song lamella flows like water, while the Ming plates stand firm like mountains. How can armor hold such spirit?Liang Shen:(smiles, his voice gentle yet steady, like the rhythm of the forge)Spirit does not dwell in the iron, Jianyu. It is carried there by the hands that shape it. Each plate, each knot of cord, each polish of the surface is more than labor&mdash;it is devotion. But remember this: what you see here is not mine alone.Jianyu:Not yours alone? But Master&hellip; your work is beyond compare!Liang Shen:(laughs softly, shaking his head)A river flows because many streams feed it. My hands would falter if not for the guidance of other masters. Eldred, for instance&mdash;his eyes are sharper than any blade. He sees flaws where others see perfection. His criticism is not cruelty, but a gift. And the guilds themselves, by standing together, sharpen us all. Without them, one smith is just a hammer in the dark. With them, we become the bell that rings clear across kingdoms.Jianyu:So even a master bows to other masters?Liang Shen:To bow is not shame&mdash;it is strength. The guilds hold us to standards higher than our own pride. Alone, we might grow careless, but among brothers of the craft, we are reminded that excellence is born from honesty, even when it stings. That is why what you see here is polished not only by fire, but by fellowship.Jianyu:I see&hellip; then when I work, I do not carry only my hammer, but also the wisdom of the guild, and of masters like Eldred.Liang Shen:Exactly, Jianyu. Every stroke you make carries voices&mdash;those who taught you, those who corrected you, those who stood beside you.Jianyu:(his eyes shining with understanding)Then I will work harder, Master. Not just for myself, but for all who stand with us.Liang Shen:(nods, his expression warm and proud)Good. Remember&mdash;true honor is not in claiming credit, but in building something greater than yourself. The guilds remind us of that. And if you hold to this spirit, one day your work will not only protect bodies, but also preserve the unity that keeps us strong.Jianyu:But still, I am surprised. You speak so openly of the help of others, as if your own work were not already legendary. Why would a man of your mastery reveal such&hellip; weakness?Liang Shen:(smiles gently, eyes glimmering like sparks in the forge)Weakness, you say? Tell me, Jianyu&mdash;why do you think Eldred&rsquo;s Gothic armor moves so lightly, so swiftly, as though it were silk instead of steel?Jianyu:(blinks, caught off guard)Because&hellip; because Eldred is a genius?Liang Shen:(chuckles, stroking his beard)A genius, yes, but also a man who listened&mdash;though he would never admit it. He sharpened his art upon the words of others, mine also. His armor dances because it carries not only his pride, but the whispers of countless guild debates and endless critiques, mine included.Jianyu:So even the greatest smiths&hellip; carry the voices of others inside their work?Liang Shen:Of course. Do not mistake silence for solitude. Our guilds, our fellow masters, even stern excentric critics like Eldred&mdash;all of them strike their hammers through others in one way or other.Jianyu:To admit such things openly, Master&hellip; does it not make you seem less?Liang Shen:(leans closer, his tone warm, yet firm)No, boy. It makes me more. Strength without humility is brittle, like steel not tempered. Only by bowing to fire and water does iron gain its true resilience. So too with men.Jianyu:I think I understand now. To forge is not to stand alone&hellip; but to stand among many, each lending their hand unseen.Liang Shen:(nods approvingly)Well said. Remember this, Jianyu: a proud smith may craft armor, but a humble smith crafts legacy." property="og:description" />

My hands would falter if not for the guidance of other masters. <br />Eldred, for instance&mdash;his eyes are sharper than any blade.

And the guilds themselves, by standing together, sharpen us all. <br />Without them, one smith is just a hammer in the dark.

It was getting harder and harder for me to get satisfying product for more "nieche" helmet designs. It wasnt my creation, base of the logo was always made by AI, and it simply refused to make proper models that i envisioned. Dont take me wrong, im a big advocate for it, it helped tremendously, but it just cant make proper Szyszak, Sallet, non of theese things, it mainly makes generic helmet in wild variations. So i felt for some time that the logos are getting a bit inconsistent.&nbsp;<br><br>And i was looking for another way to create them. This way it is much faster (much less editing the AI mistakes and unwanted output),i feel like its much more representative of an actual contents of the mod and its a better way to stay consistent for future mods.&nbsp;</p></div>

						<div class="body"><p>Firstly, thank you for your great armor mods in general and for your seemingly burning passion in developing more of them.</p>
<p>However, on a server I am on I'm considering upgrading my steel chainmail chest piece to one of the two chinese variants, as I am playing as a Hunter. But the crafting costs is kinda mystifying to me.</p>
<p>The Hu Guo(medium) chest piece appears to be requiring 24x5 sets of steel nails and strips, while the Yulinjun Kui(heavy) chest piece only requires 16x2 sets of steel nails and strips along with 3 black bronze plates. Given the arduous process of making steel, and then turning that into nails and especially so by using the smaller batches as the bigger one is wasteful in terms of ingot/plate materials, the medium variant seems <em><strong>prohibitively expensive</strong></em> in comparison to the heavy one.</p>
<p>Was this intentional pricing on your part, or is it some kind of config tweak the server I am on is currently using that is at play?</p></div>
